## Quote about the society 
> "The way societies evolve is by going from dictatorship to oligarchy to democracy to chaos and back to dictatorship." 

<cite>Plato</cite>---The Republic, 375 BC 

> "Chaotic systems come in two shapes. The weather, for example, is a level one chaotic system. History, markets and politics are level two chaotic system." 

<cite>Yuval Noah Hariri</cite>---Sapiens, 2014
